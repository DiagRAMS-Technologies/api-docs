# DiagRAMS api docs

The DiagRAMS API docs is a web-site for explain how use the API with DiagRAMS.

The DiagRAMS api docs is backed with the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
framework. We chosen it for:

- its good defaults (lots of optimization out of the box),
- its React oriented approach,
- its TypeScript compatibility.

We also use [`styled-jsx`](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) that allows us
to simply use CSS but in a scoped way. We chosen it for:

- its very low learning curve (compared to TypeScript/React/NextJS ðŸ˜…),
- its fit with our very custom design that enforce us to have a lot of custom
  components

We use Jest for testing and components librairies in order to
build interfaces starting by components.
