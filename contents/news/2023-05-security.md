# Training to cybersecurity

In an ever-evolving digital world, cybersecurity is a major concern for businesses. The DiagRAMS policy is now enriched with a new training program provided by the French national cybersecurity agency.

We are proud to announce our team recently obtained the cybersecurity certification issued by the ANSSI cybersecurity academy.

We think that despite developers taking a major role in securing our platform, any DiagRAMS collaborator should have the basic skill set to avoid well known security issues.
