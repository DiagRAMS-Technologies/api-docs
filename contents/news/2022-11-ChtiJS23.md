# ChtiJS 23 in the DiagRAMS office

The 23th ChtiJS edition took place in our office and we spend a good moment with the JavaScript developers community. JavaScript enthusiasts and even curious minds could exhange their knowledges in a friendly atmosphere.

We were proud to lead the presentations :

- Mathys Visticot could show how he implemented the Universal Search feature of our application as an intern.
- Nicolas Froidure, our CTO, presented our process for end to end typings with [TypeScript](typescriptlang.org), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/), [Whook](https://github.com/nfroidure/whook) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) ([SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/)).
